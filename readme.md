# SimpleScript

## English-like Programming Language

Welcome to SimpleScript! We have developed a programming language that is very similar to English. SimpleScript is designed to be easy to read, understand, and learn. The project is implemented using Java, with a Tkinter-based frontend in Python.

## Features

- **Variables**: Create variables with ease.
- **Data Types**: Support for strings, integers, and decimals.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic.
- **Loops**: Use `for` and `while` loops for iteration.
- **Functions**: Define and call functions.
- **List Operations**: Perform list indexing and operations.
- **String Operations**: Manipulate strings effortlessly.

## Syntax Overview

### Variables

```
this number is 5
this decimalNumber is 3.14
this name is "Alice"
this list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Function declaration
```
task greet(name)
    print "Hello, " + name + "!"
end
```


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Python 3
- Tkinter for Python

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aksaykanthan
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd 
```
3. Compile the Java backend:
```
compile and run src/shell.java
```
4. Install Tkinter
```sh
pip install tkinter
```
5. Run the Tkinter frontend:
```sh
python app.py 
```


## Usage
#### After setting up the project, you can start writing and executing scripts in our English-like programming language using the Tkinter-based frontend.
